Difference between var, let and const 
1.
   {var a = 10}
   console.log(a) // 10
   var is global scoped
   {let a = 10}
   console.log(a) // uncaght error
   let is block scoped
   {const a = 10}
   console.log(a) // uncaght error
   const is block scoped
   
 2. var a= 10,
    var a = 15,
    console.log(a) // 15
    var can be redeclared
    
    let and const can't be redeclared, if done uncaught a is already declared will come.
    
 3. var and let can be reassigned 
 
 4. Const has to be initialized, let and var does not.
 
 5. count the number of occurence of a number in an array
 
 const array = [1,2,4,6,4,6];
        
 function countOccurance(arr){
    arr.sort();
    let count = {}
    for(const element of arr){
        if(count[element]){
            count[element] = count[element]+1
        }
        else {
            count[element] = 1;
        }
    }
    return count;
 }
    
console.log(countOccurance(array));
