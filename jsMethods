Difference between var, let and const 
1.
   {var a = 10}
   console.log(a) // 10
   var is global scoped
   {let a = 10}
   console.log(a) // uncaght error
   let is block scoped
   {const a = 10}
   console.log(a) // uncaght error
   const is block scoped
   
 2. var a= 10,
    var a = 15,
    console.log(a) // 15
    var can be redeclared
    
    let and const can't be redeclared, if done uncaught a is already declared will come.
    
 3. var and let can be reassigned 
 
 4. Const has to be initialized, let and var does not.
